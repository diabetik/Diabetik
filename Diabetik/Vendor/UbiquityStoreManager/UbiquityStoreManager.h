//  UbiquityStoreManager
//
// UbiquityStoreManager is a controller for your Core Data persistence layer.
// It provides you with an NSPersistentStoreCoordinator and handles the stores for you.
// It encapsulates everything required to make Core Data integration with iCloud work as reliably as possible.
//
// Aside from this, it features the following functionality:
//
//  - Ability to switch between a separate cloud-synced and local store (an iCloud toggle).
//  - Automatically migrates local data to iCloud when the user has no iCloud store yet.
//  - Handles all iCloud related events such as:
//      - Account changes
//      - External deletion of the cloud data
//      - External deletion of the local store
//      - Importing of ubiquitous changes from other devices
//      - Recovering from exceptional events such as corrupted transaction logs
//  - Some maintenance functionality:
//      - Ability to rebuild the cloud store from transaction logs
//      - Ability to rebuild the transaction logs from the cloud store
//      - Ability to delete the cloud store (allowing it to be recreated from the local store)
//      - Ability to nuke the entire cloud container
//      - Migrate one store to another by copying all entities
//

/** Triggered when the store manager has detected that the cloud content has failed to import on one of the devices.
 *
 * TL;DR: The recommended way to implement this method is to return NO (so the default solution will be effected).
 * If storeHealthy is YES, you can show the user that iCloud is being fixed.
 * If storeHealthy is NO, you should tell the user this device is waiting and he should open the app on his other device(s) so they can
 * attempt to fix the situation.
 *
 * Why did this happen?
 *
 * When cloud content (transaction logs) fail to import into the cloud store on this device, the result is that the cloud store is no
 * longer guaranteed to be the same as the cloud store on other devices.  Moreover, there is no more guarantee that changes made to the
 * cloud store will sync to other devices.  iCloud sync for the cloud store is therefore effectively broken.
 *
 * When this happens, there is only one recovery: The cloud store must be recreated from scratch.
 *
 * Unfortunately, this situation tends to occur very easily because of an Apple bug with regards to synchronizing Core Data relationships:
 * When two devices simultaneously modify a relationship, the resulting transaction logs can cause an irreparable conflict.
 *
 * You can implement this method to be notified of when this situation occurs.  If you plan to handle the problem yourself and deal with
 * the corruption, return YES to disable the manager's default strategy.
 * If you want the manager to effect its default solution, return NO (or don't implement this method).
 *
 * The default solution to this problem is to unload the cloud store on all devices where transaction logs can no longer be imported into
 * the store.  A device that has not noticed any import problems will be notified of cloud corruption in other devices and initiate a
 * rebuild of the cloud content.
 *
 * If you want to handle the corruption yourself, you have a few options.  Keep in mind: To fix the situation you will need to create
 * a new cloud store; only a new cloud store can guarantee that all devices are back in-sync.  Here's what you could do:
 * - Switch to the local store (manager.cloudEnabled = NO).
 *      NOTE: The cloud data and cloud syncing will be unavailable.
 * - Delete the cloud data and recreate it by seeding it with the local store ([manager deleteCloudStoreLocalOnly:NO]).
 *      NOTE: The existing cloud data will be lost.
 * - Make the existing cloud data local and disable iCloud ([manager migrateCloudToLocal]).
 *      NOTE: The existing local store will be lost.
 *      NOTE: The cloud data known by this device will become available again.
 *      NOTE: The cloud store is still in a corrupt state.  The user can either re-try later, or you can rebuild the cloud store from
  *           the local store ([manager deleteCloudStoreLocalOnly:NO]).
 * - Rebuild the cloud content by seeding it with the cloud store of this device ([manager rebuildCloudContentFromCloudStoreOrLocalStore:YES]).
 *      NOTE: iCloud functionality will be completely restored with the cloud data known by this device.
 *      NOTE: Any cloud changes on other devices that failed to sync to this device will be lost.
 *      NOTE: If you specify YES for allowRebuildFromLocalStore and the cloud store on this device is unusable for repairing the cloud
  *           content, a new cloud store will be created from the local store instead.
 *
 * Keep in mind that if storeHealthy is YES, the cloud store will, if enabled, still be loaded.  If storeHealthy is NO, the cloud store
 * will, if enabled, have been unloaded before this method is called and no store will be available at this point.
 *
 * This method will be invoked from the persistence queue.  What you do here will block the persistence loading progress.  The cloud store
 * will have been unloaded and there will be no store loaded when this method is called unless when the cloud store is not enabled
 * (in which case the local store may be loaded).
 *
 * @param storeHealthy YES if this device has no loading or syncing problems with the cloud store.
 *                     NO if this device can no longer open or sync with the cloud store.
 * @return YES if you've handled the corruption yourself and want to disable the manager's default strategy for resolving corruption.
 *         NO if you just use this method to inform the user or your application and want the manager to handle the problem for you.
